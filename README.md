sum of percentage of 2nd suitcase: 125.6
sum of percentage of 3rd suitcase: 17.8



- From here we can see that the sum of percenrage for 2nd suitcase is greater than 100 (%) where as that of 3rd suitcase is significantly lower. Therefore, I am not going to choose the 3rd suitcase since the sharp ratio is too low.
